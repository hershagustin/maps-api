# 🗺 Google Maps JavaScript API Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of the **Google Maps JavaScript API** to create interactive, dynamic maps integrated into a custom web layout. The project showcases multiple map types, custom markers, infowindows, shapes, and overlays with event-driven interactivity.

All features are original and designed to provide a clean, user-friendly interface with real-world locations.
